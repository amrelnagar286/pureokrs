## Development server

Run `ng build --output-path=dist --watch=true` to build the angular app to be run by the node server. Changes made to the app are automatically detected.

Run `node server` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
